However, many renderers -- like Github's and Markdown Here -- support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. Markdown Here supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the highlight.js demo page.\n\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n\nBlocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.\n\n```javascript\nvar s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\";\nalert(s);\n```\n \n```python\ns = \"Python syntax highlighting\"\nprint s\n```\n \n```\nNo language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. \nBut let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.\n```\n\n# Tables\n\nTables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.\n\nColons can be used to align columns.\n\n| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |\n| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |\n| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |\n\nThere must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.\nThe outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the \nraw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.\n\nMarkdown | Less | Pretty\n--- | --- | ---\n*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**\n1 | 2 | 3\n\n# Blockquotes\n\n> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.\n> This line is part of the same quote.\n\n# Quote break.\n\n> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. \n\n# Inline HTML\n\nYou can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.\n\n<dl>\n  <dt>Definition list</dt>\n  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>\n\n  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>\n  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>\n</dl>\n\nDefinition list\n    Is something people use sometimes.\nMarkdown in HTML\n    Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML tags.\n\n# Horizontal Rule\n\nThree or more...\n\n---\n\nHyphens\n\n***\n\nAsterisks\n\n___\n\nUnderscores\n\n# Line Breaks\n\nMy basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- hit <Enter> once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You'll soon learn to get what you want. \"Markdown Toggle\" is your friend.\n\nHere are some things to try out:\n\nHere's a line for us to start with.\n\nThis line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.\n\nThis line is also a separate paragraph, but...\nThis line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.\n\n(Technical note: Markdown Here uses GFM line breaks, so there's no need to use MD's two-space line breaks.)\n\n# Youtube videos\n\nThey can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE\n\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg\" \nalt=\"IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" border=\"10\" /></a>\n\nOr, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:\n\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/FrG4TEcSuRg/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrG4TEcSuRg)\n\nReferencing a bug by #bugID in your git commit links it to the slip. For example #1. \n","ingredients":"","procedure":"","category":"people","tags":["MARKDOWN","TECHNICAL"]}]
